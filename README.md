I developed a sophisticated quotation generation website to streamline and replace traditional Excel-based workflows. This initiative was driven by the need to enhance efficiency and accuracy in the quotation process. By transitioning from manual spreadsheets to an automated web-based system, we achieved significant time savings and minimized the risk of data entry errors.

The website was built with a focus on user-friendly design and robust functionality. I engineered APIs to facilitate seamless interaction between the website and its underlying database. These APIs were crucial in managing data operations, including the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of quotation records. The result was a more efficient and reliable system that not only accelerated the generation of quotations but also ensured that the data was consistently accurate and up-to-date.

Overall, this project significantly improved the performance and usability of the quotation process. It streamlined workflows, reduced manual effort, and enhanced data integrity, contributing to a more effective and error-free quotation management system. This upgrade not only optimized internal operations but also provided a more reliable and scalable solution for future needs.
